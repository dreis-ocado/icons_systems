### Why a library

- Check for consistency
- Context
- Guidelines (if any)

###Consistency:
Test if all icons look the same in terms of level of detail, weight, stroke, position and perspective. 

1. Fontawesome icons visually look quite different from all the other custom icons across different systems

###Context: 
1. Icons with similar context look different across systems
2. Similar icons have different context on different system sections. 

###Guidelines:
Not clearly defined.  
1. Some icons are filled and other outlined
2. Different line weights
3. More than one color used with no defined color palette

###Next Steps:
The process of discovery should be taken from scratch. Go through all the systems again and probably speak with the designers (?) to try to assess why they used certain icons in different locations and what icons they think translate better meaning on their designs.  

Also ask the following questions about the current set of icons:
1. Findability: Can people find the icon on the page?
2. Recognition: Do people understand what the icon represents?
3. Information scent: Can users correctly guess what will happen once they interact with the icon?

Two more general questions (**added from Aeris meeting 17/09/2018)
1. Do we need icons? Why?
2. What are the priority icons to have?
